# SeoS V-Slice 

Just a port of [Smoke 'Em Out Struggle](https://gamebanana.com/mods/166531) to Funkin V-Slice.

> [!CAUTION]
> You have to unarchived the repository in order to play the modpack (this doesn't support the use of zip files), otherwise the `release` song cutscene won't play and you'll be soft locked.

## TODO

- Change the health bar color for `garcello` to purple.
- Fix the pause between `release` song cutscene end and the camera fade.
